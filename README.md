# Christmas time exercice

Fast exercice (around 1hour) to avoid rustiness during the christmas break.

## Instructions :

Starting from this image :
![model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa550ba-2c8a-4470-ba15-786f606ca925)

Create corresponding classes and styling to achieve a similar result.


### What I did :

To achieve the goal in a timely manner, I focused on only one Recipe class, and created the objects directly in index.php.
I used the method createRecipeCard from the Recipe class to create all the relevant html.
In the end, index.php is used solely to create the recipe objects and call the method via a foreach function.
I kept the css media queries to a minimum, but still achieved a responsive design via using flex-direction.
